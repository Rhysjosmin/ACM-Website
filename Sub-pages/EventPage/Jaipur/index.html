        The DBCE ACM Chapter of Don Bosco College of Engineering recently took a tour to Jaipur, the pink city of India, which was an experience worth cherishing. The tour was not only a great way to explore the city's rich cultural heritage but also an opportunity for the ACM members to learn about various industries and production pipelines.
<br>
<br>
        The first destination on the tour was Hindware, a leading sanitary ware brand that gave the members an insight into the manufacturing process of bathroom fittings. The ACM members learned about the intricate processes involved in the production of sanitary ware, which is a highly technical and detail-oriented industry.
<br>
<br>
        
        The next stop was the University of Rajasthan, which was an enriching experience for the students. They got a chance to interact with the students and faculty members of the university and learn about their research work and academic achievements. The ACM members also visited the World Trade Park, which is a popular shopping destination in Jaipur.
<br>
<br>
        
        One of the most interesting experiences of the tour was the visit to the marble processing units in Kishangarh. The members learned about the production pipeline and the manufacturing process of marble. They witnessed the intricate carving work and the various stages of marble processing.
<br>
<br>
        
        Later on, the group explored the beauty of Jaipur and visited the Marble dump, which was a sight to behold. Despite being a dump, the place was beautiful and looked like something out of a fairytale. The members enjoyed the scenic views and captured some breathtaking photos.
<br>
<br>
        
        On the second last day of the tour, the group visited the famous forts of Jaipur, which included Amer Fort, Jaigarh Fort, Nahagarh Fort, Jal Mahal, City Palace, Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal, and Albert Museum. The members learned about the rich history of these forts and the cultural significance they hold. They also explored the beautiful architecture and intricate details of these structures.
<br>
<br>
        
        Overall, the tour was a great success, and the ACM members and faculty learned a lot about the culture and heritage of Jaipur. It was an opportunity for the students to step out of their comfort zone, explore new places, and learn about different industries and production processes. The tour was an excellent blend of fun, learning, and cultural exploration.
      
<br>
<br><br>
The tour to Jaipur was made possible by the efforts of the faculty and the ACM members. The faculty members who accompanied the group were Dr Gaurang Patkar, the Faculty Coordinator, and Mrs Manisha Dessai, who provided guidance and support throughout the tour. They ensured that the members were safe and made the most of their experience in Jaipur.
<br>
<br>
The success of the tour was also due to the contributions of the ACM student leaders. Pratham Shah, the Chairman of the ACM Chapter, played a crucial role in organizing the tour and ensuring that everything went smoothly. He was assisted by Vadiraj Inamdar, the Vice Chairman, who helped in coordinating the logistics and Rudra Kande, the Treasurer, who managed the finances of the tour.
<br>
<br>
The teamwork and dedication of the faculty and the ACM members made the tour a great success, and it was a memorable experience for everyone involved. It is essential to acknowledge the contributions of the faculty and the ACM leaders, who worked tirelessly to make the tour a reality. Their efforts were instrumental in ensuring that the members had a fantastic learning experience while exploring the beauty and culture of Jaipur.
