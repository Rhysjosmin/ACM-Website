        The DBCE ACM Chapter of Don Bosco College of Engineering recently embarked on an exciting trip to the vibrant city of Jaipur. The trip was not only a great opportunity for the members to explore and relax but also a fantastic learning experience.
<br>
<br>
The faculty members who accompanied the members were the faculty coordinator, Dr. Gaurang Patkar, and Mrs. Manisha Dessai. They played a crucial role in organizing and planning the trip. The leadership of the trip was led by Pratham Shah, the Chairman, who was assisted by Vadiraj Inamdar, the Vice-Chairman, and Rudra Kande, the Treasurer.
<br>
<br>
After reaching Jaipur, the group checked into their hotel and took some time to unwind. Later, they headed to Kishangar to visit the marble association where they were able to learn about the automation process and production pipeline. This visit gave the members a chance to witness firsthand how technology has been integrated into the production process of the marble industry.
<br>
<br>
On the following day, the group visited the University of Rajasthan where they witnessed a hackathon taking place. They were able to interact with different technical and non-technical departments and learn about the innovative ideas being implemented by students. This experience proved to be enriching and informative.
<br>
<br>
Later in the day, the group visited the World Trade Center where they had the chance to meet with startup companies. These companies gave them a presentation about their working style and business models. This visit proved to be a great opportunity for the members to learn about the dynamics of the startup industry in India.
<br>
<br>
The next day, the members explored the gems of Jaipur by visiting several forts such as Amer Fort, Jaigarh Fort, Nahagarh Fort, Jal Mahal, City Palace, Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal, and Albert Museum. During the visit, they learned about the rich history and culture of the city. The members were amazed by the intricate architecture and the historical significance of these places.
<br>
<br>
The last day of the trip was reserved for relaxation. The members were able to take a break and enjoy the city at their own pace. This allowed them to reflect on the experiences they had over the past few days.
<br>
<br>
Overall, the trip was an excellent learning experience for the members of the DBCE ACM Chapter. They not only got to learn about the latest technologies and innovations but also had the chance to experience the rich cultural heritage of Jaipur.
